# Web Application Monitoring, Scaling and Automation

## Overview

This repository contains scripts and configurations to automate the deployment and management of a scalable web application infrastructure on AWS using boto3 and various AWS services.

### Features
* Web Application Deployment
* Load Balancing with ELB
* Auto Scaling Group (ASG) Configuration
* Lambda-based Health Checks & Management
* S3 Logging & Monitoring
* SNS Notifications
* Infrastructure Automation

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following set up:

* AWS account with appropriate permissions.
* Python environment with boto3 installed.
* Access and Secret Keys configured for AWS credentials.

## Deployment Steps
1. Web Application Deployment:

* Use boto3 to create an S3 bucket for static files.
* Launch an EC2 instance and configure it as a web server.
* Deploy the web application onto the EC2 instance.

2. Load Balancing with ELB:

* Deploy an Application Load Balancer using boto3.
* Register the EC2 instance(s) with the ALB.

3. Auto Scaling Group (ASG) Configuration:

* Create an ASG with the deployed EC2 instance as a template.
* Configure scaling policies based on metrics (e.g., CPU, network).
4. Lambda-based Health Checks & Management:

* Develop a Lambda function for health checks via ALB.
* Implement actions for consistent failures: snapshot, terminate, notify.

5. S3 Logging & Monitoring:

* Configure ALB to send access logs to the S3 bucket.
* Create a monitoring Lambda for log analysis & alerts.

6. SNS Notifications:

* Set up SNS topics for various alerts.
* Integrate SNS with Lambda for admin notifications.

7. Infrastructure Automation:

* Use a script leveraging boto3 to deploy, update, and teardown infrastructure.


## Usage
* Clone this repository.
* Ensure AWS credentials are configured.
* Execute the deployment script
